Instead of jumping straight into JS Fundamentals, I thought it best to get my head around Flexbox. I used a lot of different techniques in my first Google-Homepage project, and I didn't really understand what was going on. 

So I decided to redo the Google-Homepage, to see how much HTML knowledge I had retained and to get a better understanding of Flexbox for future projects. 

This time around, the HTML was a lot simpler, due to it probably being still fresh in my mind. I used alot more <div> tags compared to my first to be able to utilise Flexbox. 

During the CSS stage, I had some struggles with getting the footer to appear at the bottom of the page. I was adviced to not use Height: 100%; in my body, and upon changing it to 100vh; the footer dropped to the bottom, only to reappear in the middle once I carried on with the code. 

More help later, it was recitfied and I'm a lot more proud of this project than my first. I was personally to eager to just push forward and skipped so many steps on the first project, which in hindsight will help me in the future. This time, the project is done correctly and looks a lot better. 

CSS is still the baine of my coding learning, but I'm confident that with more projects, I will be able to wrap my head around it.
